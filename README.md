# WavesInfo

This is a simple app to assist Crossout players with playing that good old 1-hour long new year raid.

## Instructions

1) Download .exe and .xlsx files from Releases tab
2) Run the .exe
3) Open the .xlsx waves file 
4) Run crossout and login
5) Open current combat.log file (`Documents\My Games\Crossout\logs\<date>\combat.log`)
6) Select your desired options (such as `Autorefresh log file` and `Stay on top`)
7) It still wont be visible above the game, so you have a few options here:
    - Run the app on your second screen if you have one
    - Use some 3rd party software to draw an overlay above your game (i've heard PlayClaw can do it, but they be kinda sus). Keep in mind that game has anti-cheat and anti-cheats dont like it when someone is trying to draw an overlay.
    - Run crossout in windowed mode (not fullscreen-windowed)

## Notes

+ You can edit notes and wave info by editing .xlsx file
+ You can suggest more info for the waves file via the Issues tab
